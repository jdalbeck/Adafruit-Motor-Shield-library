This fork of the Adafruit Motor Shield v1 library adds support for the Wemos D1 R32 (ESP32) board.

While the v1 of the motor shield is antiquated and inefficient, it is still the cheapest motor shield available.  In combination with the Wemos D1 R32 board, it makes a great, economical platform for 3D printed robots that are designed around the Arduino Uno/Shield form factor (e.g. SMARS).

To install, click the "Code" dropdown button above, then click "Download ZIP".  Extract the folder "Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library" to your Arduino IDE "libraries" folder.
